# Changelog

All notable changes to the Sight Word Story Generator project.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-13

### Scene-Based Story Composition System

**Status**: ✅ Complete

Major enhancement to story generation that produces coherent, temporally-ordered narratives instead of disconnected sentences.

#### Added

**Story Composition System**:

- `lib/storyScenes.js` - Library of 40+ modular scenes organized into 10 temporal phases
- `lib/storyComposer.js` - Intelligent scene selection based on sight word coverage
- Stories now follow natural day progression: wake up → morning routine → leave home → activities → return home → evening → bedtime

**Temporal Phases (10 stages)**:

1. WAKE_UP - Character wakes up in the morning
2. MORNING_ROUTINE - Wash up, get dressed, eat breakfast
3. LEAVE_HOME - Go outside
4. TRAVEL - Walk or bike somewhere
5. ACTIVITY_1-3 - Main activities of the day
6. RETURN_HOME - Say goodbye, walk home
7. EVENING - Dinner, bedtime reading
8. BEDTIME - Go to sleep

#### Changed

**Story Generation**:

- Refactored `lib/storyGeneration.js` to use new scene composition system
- Stories now have logical flow with proper transitions
- No more temporal jumps (e.g., washing up after breakfast)
- No contradictory scenes (e.g., breakfast appearing twice)

**Image Generation**:

- Refactored `lib/imageGeneration.js` for better context-aware illustrations
- Improved sentence analysis for location/action/weather detection
- Better variety in generated illustrations

**Story Preview**:

- Fixed `components/StoryPreview.js` to show accurate sight word usage counts
- Now displays `usedWords` (actually used) vs `words` (all input)

#### Fixed

- Stories no longer have temporal inconsistencies
- Sight word count now reflects actual words used in the story
- Illustrations better match sentence content

**Total Monthly Cost**: $0

### Why It's Free

- No API costs - Uses SVG illustrations generated in-browser
- Free hosting - Vercel free tier
- Free database - MongoDB Atlas free tier
- Optional email - Free SMTP services available
- No subscriptions, no trial periods, no premium tiers
- All features included for everyone
