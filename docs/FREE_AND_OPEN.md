# 💰 Free and Open Source

## This Tool is 100% Free Forever

The Sight Word Story Generator is designed to be **completely free** for all teachers, parents, and educational institutions. Here's why and how we keep it free:

---

## Why Free?

**Our Mission**: Every child deserves access to quality literacy tools, and every teacher should have the resources they need without worrying about budgets.

Many educational apps lock essential features behind paywalls. We believe sight word practice is too important to charge for.

## Sustainability

### "How do you keep it running?"

Good question! Here's our approach:

1. **Efficient Architecture**
   - Serverless functions (only pay for usage)
   - Static assets (cached globally)
   - Minimal database queries
   - Optimized images

2. **Free Tier Limits**
   - MongoDB: 512MB (thousands of stories)
   - Vercel: 100GB bandwidth/month
   - These limits are generous for educational use

3. **Community Support**
   - Open source contributions
   - Bug reports and testing
   - Feature suggestions
   - Documentation improvements

### "What if it gets popular?"

If we outgrow free tiers:

- Vercel Pro: $20/month (100x the capacity)
- MongoDB M10: $9/month (2GB storage)
- **Still way cheaper than competitors!**

We'll cross that bridge when we get there, and keep it free for teachers.

## What About Email Sharing?

**Email is Optional** and free if you want it:

### Free Options

1. **Gmail** - Use app-specific password (free)
2. **Outlook** - SMTP available (free)
3. **SendGrid** - Free tier: 100 emails/day
4. **Mailgun** - Free tier: 100 emails/day

### Or Skip It

- Share by downloading
- Email is nice-to-have, not essential

## Questions?

### "Will you add paid features later?"

**No.** Core functionality will always be free. If we ever add paid features, they'll be extras (like enterprise analytics for school districts), never core teaching features.

### "Can I donate?"

Not accepting donations currently. The best support is:

- Using it with your students
- Sharing feedback
- Telling other teachers
- Contributing to the code

### "What if I need support?"

- Check the documentation
- Open a GitHub issue
- Join the community discussions
- Help each other (teachers helping teachers!)
